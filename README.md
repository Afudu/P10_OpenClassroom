## Summary
This project consists of developing for **SoftDesk**, a product-based company, 
a secure a RESTful issue-tracking API.

The tracking application covers all three platforms (Web, Android, and iOS), and enables users to create projects, 
add users as contributors to a particular project, create issues in a project, and add comments to an issue.

## Features
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based and Ownership-based secure access.
- **API Endpoints**: Support CRUD (create, read, update, and delete).

   git clone https://github.com/Afudu/P10_OpenClassroom.git

2. **Move to the folder**
   ```bash
   cd P10_OpenClassroom

3. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
4. **Activate Environment**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate 

5. **Securely upgrade pip**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip 

6. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
7. **To deactivate Environment**
   ```bash
   deactivate

### Setup on Windows

1. Follow the steps above.

2. To activate the environment:
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate

### Running the application

1. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   cd SoftDesk; python manage.py runserver
   
2. **Access in the browser**
- To register, navigate to:
  ```bash
  http://localhost:8000/api/signup

- To log in, navigate to:
  ```bash
  http://localhost:8000/api/login

### Admin Panel
1. Create a superuser account
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
2. Navigate to:
   ```bash
    http://localhost:8000/admin
3. Use the superuser user created above to log in.

### Linting and Testing

- **Run Linting**
  ```bash
  flake8

- **Tests**

   * Signup and Login endpoints do not require an access token.
  
   * All other endpoints require an access token to work, and can be tested using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or any other tool like cURL or Django REST frameworkâ€™s localhost server.
  
   * The tests performed and their results can be viewed from this [link](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25994788/2sA3JRafGj).
